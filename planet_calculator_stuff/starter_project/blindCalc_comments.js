// the object is called planetWeights
// iterate over gravityFactors
// assign a key, value pair to planetWeights for each iteration
// the value of each key should be earthWeight times the value of the current
// iteration of gravityFactors
// Make sure the values are floats to two decimals
// return the planetWeights object from the function

// console log the planetWeights assume the function
